## GENERAL INFO

> If you want to use this repository it is required that you're familiar with Gulp and Javascript.
> It is also recommended that you're familiar with the node modules it uses.
>
> If you're familiar with Gulp and JavaScript then it's very easy for you to add new modules or modify modules behaviour.
>
> Try not to modify any other but `config.js` files, unless you know what you are doing.
>
> Configuration files (`config.js`) are commented for explanations, which should be fine for most people familiar with Gulp and JavaScript. Almost everything is configurable.
>
> If you're developing with WordPress, you have to have a local WordPress site (with local server, like XAMPP) to proxy it with browsersync, because browsersync can't serve php. The settings for that are made automatically, just edit the project and wp config.
>
> Use TODOs like: `TODO:` or `FIXME:` in an appropriate comment (ex: // TODO: change this), to get all todos and fixmes in a .txt file in the root dir.\
> Read more at: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-todo>

## FEATURES

### General

- :information_source: [easily add or remove modules](#addremove-a-module) (add your HTML processor instead of nunjucks)
- develop a static page or with php/wordpress
- option to proxy a domain (e.g. from local server), when working with php/wordpress
- 'dev' and 'prod' mode: control developer headers for css and js, sourcemaps, js console logs, doiuse and todo logs
- process Nunjucks (:information_source:), SCSS, JavaSript, images, minify and inline svg in css, create svg sprites
- copy (to assets) files that don't have to be processed, e.g. fonts, sounds... so all source files can be in one place
- sourcemaps for SCSS and JS
- create [humans.txt](https://humanstxt.org/) file
- :information_source: :information_source: notification on plugin errors (so you don't have to keep the console open)
- sound on task completion (so you don't have to keep the console open)

> :information_source: It is easy to add your HTML preprocessor, see [Add your HTML preprocessor in three steps](#add-your-html-preprocessor-in-three-steps)
>
> :information_source: :information_source: Windows 10 Note:\
> You might have to activate banner notification for the toast to show. You can make it work by going to System > Notifications & Actions. The 'toast' app needs to have Banners enabled. (You can activate banners by clicking on the 'toast' app and setting the 'Show notification banners' to On)

### Gulp

- watch for file changes and run the appropriate task on each file change (save, delete, new file)
- restart gulp on any config change and apply new settings
- tasks don't break on plugin errors ([gulp-plumber](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-plumber))
- web server with streaming CSS files on change, and reloading page on HTML and JS change, proxying a domain with php/wordpress

### Wordpress

- :information_source: unzip automatically [underscores theme template](https://underscores.me)
- :information_source: :information_source: replace placeholder slug and text-domain automatically, in all files, if using a placeholder theme
- theme is initialised automatically - directory, index.php, screenshot placeholder and style.css
- copy files to the destination on any file change
- :warning: concatenate files
- populate all TODOs and FIXMEs from .php files into LOG-TODO-WP.txt, in the project root
- update [humans.txt](https://humanstxt.org/) on each build

> This may look like an ordinary duplication of files, but I believe it's better to keep all source files in one place. This way you can zip the theme without anything that does not belong there.\
> Another good thing is concatenating files, where you can have numerous small, well documented files in one folder, add or remove them and have them all concatenated into one file in the destination, like functions.php.
>
> :information_source: If you want to use underscores starter theme, then download it first, place it into the wordpress source dir, make all required configurations, and then run gulp. It will be unzipped and all config done automatically.
>
> :information_source: :information_source: Placeholder theme would be a theme that is created once, and used for all projects, with some particular name, which is used as theme slug and text domain placeholder which is easy to replace whithout errors.\
> It is always a good idea to download a new starter theme for each new project, because they maintain (update) it.
>
> :warning: **Concatenation removes all occurences of `<?php` and `?>` from each file. They will be prepended/appended to each produced file, which makes this option useful only for files that contain only php code.**
>
> If you have many functions or filters in functions.php, which may also be documented (// commented) for usage, configuration, source info, potential issues etc., then you can get a very long file, which is difficult to manage.\
> That is the reason for this option, which at first looks usless with PHP.\
> This way you can split code in smaller files (which you just add or remove from the folder) and concatenate them, to avoid unneccessary server side includes.

### Nunjucks

- configure global variables and filters for usage in .njk files
- format output HTML
- change output file extension
- a TODO file (.txt) with all todos and fixmes in the project's root folder
- [Humans.txt](https://humanstxt.org/) is being updated on each build

> :warning: Always build html before publishing it and after having finished bulding CSS and Javascript, to update their cachebust in HTML (e.g. src:"/main.js?20211010212110").
>
> :information_source: Activating watcher for this (JSON) file is probably not a good idea, because it would build HTML on any change in JavaScript and SCSS files.
>
> :information_source: It is easy to add your HTML preprocessor, see [Add your HTML preprocessor in three steps](#add-your-html-preprocessor-in-three-steps)

### SCSS

- clean output folder (delete all built files) before every build
- [sourcemaps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sourcemaps)
- choose what comments to keep
- prefix CSS with [autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer)
- target browsers configuration for [autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer) and [doiuse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/doiuse)
- :warning: remove unused selectors from CSS ([purgeCss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-purgecss))
- get removed selectors from CSS in a .rejected.css ([purgeCss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-purgecss))
- group media queries in CSS, depending on your design way (mobile/desktop first)
- [fix flex bugs](https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs)
- [minify and inline svg files](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-inline-svg)
- [doiuse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/doiuse) .txt file in the root, with CSS features that are not supported by certain browsers
- format CSS
- minify with CSSO
- cachebusting (JSON file for usage with HTML processor)
- a TODO file (.txt) with all todos and fixmes in the project's root folder
- add developer or license info at the top of CSS files (in 'prod' environment)
- [humans.txt](https://humanstxt.org/) is being updated on each build

> :warning: If the CSS does not work, check purgeCSS rejected file, to see if the selector has been removed. It happens with selectors dinamically created with Javascript - e.g. element.classlist.add(someVar + '--some-modifier'). Such selectors [purgeCss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-purgecss) can't see. Use SCSS config to add selectors that should always be kept.

### JavaScript

- clean output folder (delete all built files) before every build
- multiple bundles can be created, with multiple transpilations for each (target browsers configuration for babel)
- choose what comments to keep in minified files, for each bundle
- different output folder can be set for each bundle
- [sourcemaps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sourcemaps)
- cachebusting (JSON file for usage with HTML processor)
- minification with [gulp-uglify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-uglify)
- console logs are being removed from the code during minification, in 'prod' environment
- a TODO file (.txt) with all todos and fixmes in the project's root folder
- add developer or license info at the top of JS bundles, in 'prod' environment
- [humans.txt](https://humanstxt.org/) is being updated on each build

### Images

- clean output folder (delete all built files) before every build
- keep or remove metadata
- :information_source: blurred placeholder SVG, base64 encoded, placed in scss maps, in separate files for large and small placeholders
- create different image sizes (from one image)
- compress and/or crop images (jpg, png, webp, svg)
- [humans.txt](https://humanstxt.org/) is being updated on each build

> :information_source: Read more about SVG placeholders at [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/the-blur-up-technique-for-loading-background-images)

### SVG Sprites

- set folders whose content (SVG files) will be merged into a 'sprite'
- create multiple sprites, with different options for each
- minify SVGs
- option to keep/remove doctype
- prefixed IDs are automatically generated by sprite name, dir and filename, so files with same filenames (in different directories) are possible, IDs will stil be unique

> :information_source: Inline SVGs in browser, not with Gulp, because of caching.
>
> :information_source: Read more about SVG sprites at [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/svg-symbol-good-choice-icons/)

### File Copy

- clean output folders before every copy
- set array of folders in the 'src' folder to copy files without processing them

---

## USAGE

> **Default config should be good for most users. To start, project config and source files/folders (config.js file) for each module have to be configured.**
>
> Configuration files (`config.js`) are commented for explanations, which should be fine for people familiar with Gulp and JavaScript.

1. Use project config:

   - Set basic project info in `config-project.js`
   - Set development environment in `config.build.env: 'dev'`
   - Set design type in `config.build.type`, static or wordpress - this configures the server and assets folder/links
   - set main folder names (not path) in `config.dirname`
   - set source directories (path) in `const dirs`
   - set specific files (cachebust, img placeholders) in `const files` (path)

2. Configure each module's config in its configuration file.

3. The `gulpfile.js` file is already set:

   ```javascript
   const gwsb = require('./gulp-wsb');
   exports.default = gwsb.run;
   ```

That's all.

If you are using underscores theme, place its zip file in the wp source dir for it to be unzipped automatically.\
Now just navigate in your console to your project folder and type 'gulp'.

On every config change the gulp process will restart and apply the new config.

If you rename the `gulp-wsb` folder, just rename it in `gulpfile.js` as well.

All found modules are imported automatically. The missing ones will not cause error, only will display an info in console, that the module was not found.

Each module has a README with usage information.

## INSTALLATION

> :warning: If adding a new plugin in the pipeline, if you're using Sourcemaps, the new plugin has to be [compatible with gulp-sourcemaps](https://github.com/gulp-sourcemaps/gulp-sourcemaps/wiki/Plugins-with-gulp-sourcemaps-support).

Place this repository in your project root directory. File/folder structure should be like this (with default config):

- .git
- .vscode
- htdocs (or public_html etc., depending on your config, will be created and named from the config)
  - assets
  - humans.txt
  - ... (other files/folders)
- **gulp-wsb <==============**
  - build-modules
  - common-fn
  - index.js
  - project-config.js
- node_modules
- src
  - img
  - js
  - nunjucks
  - scss
  - ... (other files/folders)
- gulpfile.js
- LICENSE

```

> :information_source: It's understood that you navigate in your console where you want to install node_modules.
>
> Each module's README file contains all node modules required for it.

### Add/remove a gulp-wsb module

It is possible to remove modules that are not required (just delete the folder).

It is also possible to add your own module for a specific language:

- Create a folder in "build-modules" folder (name it by the language/technology)
- Use existing files from other modules as an example for how to create config and index files
- Include this new module in the main `index.js` file (next to `project-config.js`), in the 'M O D U L E S' section (search for 'ADD ALL MODULES HERE'), and create a watcher, if required.

### Add your HTML preprocessor in three steps

1. Create a new module (by copying the existing nunjucks module) and rename it
2. Require your preprosessor at the top of the `index.js` file, in:
   "const htmlProcessor = require('gulp-nunjucks-render');"
3. In `config.js` file: remove "const manageEnvironment" and modify "const config" object
