/// It’s widely accepted that self-hosted fonts are the fastest option:
/// same origin means reduced network negotiation, predictable URLs
/// mean we can preload, self-hosted means we can set our own cache-control
/// directives, and full ownership mitigates the risks that come with
/// leaving static assets on third-party origins.

/// font-display
/// The font-display descriptor determines how a font face is
/// displayed based on whether and when it is downloaded and
/// ready to use.
/// * auto: The font display strategy is defined by the user agent.
/// * block: Gives the font face a short block period and an
///   infinite swap period.
/// * swap: Gives the font face an extremely small block period
///   and an infinite swap period.
/// * fallback: Gives the font face an extremely small block
///   period and a short swap period.
/// * optional: Gives the font face an extremely small block
///   period and no swap period.
