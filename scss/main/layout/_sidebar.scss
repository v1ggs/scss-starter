///  <aside>: The Aside element
/// The <aside> HTML element represents a portion of a document whose
/// content is only indirectly related to the document's main content.
/// Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.
/// Do not use the <aside> element to tag parenthesized text,
/// as this kind of text is considered part of the main flow.

/// In HTML5 itâ€™s only defined that aside is "related to the content
/// around the aside element".
/// In HTML 5.1 (CR):
/// @link https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/sections.html#the-aside-element
/// the definition became more specific, as it now says that
/// aside is "related to the content of the parenting sectioning content".
/// Following the newer definition, the aside element should be inside of
/// the section element to which it is related. The main element is not a
/// sectioning element (elements like article, section, body, figure etc. are).
/// You can of course still place aside in main, but it will be related to
/// the nearest sectioning element parent of main.
