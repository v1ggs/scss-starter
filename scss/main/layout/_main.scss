/// <main>
/// The <main> HTML element represents the dominant content of the <body>
/// of a document. The main content area consists of content that is
/// directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document,
/// or the central functionality of an application.
///
/// The content of a <main> element should be unique to the document.
/// Content that is repeated across a set of documents or document
/// sections such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information,
/// site logos, and search forms shouldn't be included unless the search
/// form is the main function of the page.
/// <main> doesn't contribute to the document's outline; that is, unlike
/// elements such as <body>, headings such as <h2>, and such, <main>
/// doesn't affect the DOM's concept of the structure of the page.
/// It's strictly informative.
